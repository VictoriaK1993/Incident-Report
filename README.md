# Incident-Report

Incident response (sometimes called cybersecurity incident response) refers to an organizationâ€™s processes and technologies for detecting and responding to cyberthreats, security breaches or cyberattacks. A formal incident response plan enables cybersecurity teams to limit or prevent damage.

The goal of incident response is to prevent cyberattacks before they happen, and to minimize the cost and business disruption resulting from any cyberattacks that occur.

Ideally, an organization defines incident response processes and technologies in a formal incident response plan (IRP) that specifies exactly how different types of cyberattacks should be identified, contained, and resolved. An effective incident response plan can help cybersecurity teams detect and contain cyberthreats and restore affected systems faster, and reduce the lost revenue, regulatory fines, and other costs associate with these threats.
